# project_3

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This project would allow a user to see the frequency of a specific item in a text file, or grocery system. It also allowed them to see all of the frequencies of each item, with the number of each as well as shown in a histogram format. 

What did you do particularly well?
-I created the menu option well, to be displayed easily to the user, and in a clean and readable way. I also was able to complete option one of the grocery menu well by printing an accurate count of each product the user would input, and having a validation check to make sure the user was inputting valid values.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I could enhance my code by combining some areas and making it more concise overall. I could also enhance it for only printing the values once, meaning if the text files has multiple of one type of grocery item, it would only be printed once with its frequency.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-The piece of code I found the most challenging was the while loop and getting it to continue until the user wanted to choose option 4 (exit), and to not create an infinite loop when they selected an option not in the menu. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-The skills that will be transferable will be the documentation practices I used to allow an outside reader to understand why I used certain processes, the way I organized my code in different classes to only group what was related to not have too much clutter, and uaing understandable variable names for someone to easily understand what they are intended for. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I made it maintainable by separating things that were related in their own class, I tried to use functions where I could and variables so that nothing would be hard coded, making it adaptable. I made it readable by keeping things spaced out evenly, and not having long lines of code that would be hard to understand in one chunk.
